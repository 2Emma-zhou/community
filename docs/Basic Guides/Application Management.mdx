supOS supports service routing based on Konga, and you can add your application to supOS for integrated entry. Following certain rules, you can:
- Set the routing path to your backend service.
- Fashion access authorization mechanisms.
- Add external service to supOS frontend as one of the applications.

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>parentName:menu.tag.xxx</td>
                <td>xxx is the name of an existing first-level menu in supOS (all in lowercase). It indicates that the current route appears as a second-level menu of xxx.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>homeParentName:menu.tag.xxx</td>
                <td>xxx is the name of an existing first-level menu in supOS (all in lowercase). It indicates that the current route appears in the navigation bar and serves as a second-level menu of xxx.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>description:menu.desc.xxx</td>
                <td>xxx is the name of the route. It represents the description information corresponding to xxx.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
